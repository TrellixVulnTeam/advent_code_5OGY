# Maria's Advent of Code

## What is this?
Honestly, it's not very interesting. This is just me slowly working through all the Advent of Code activities, starting in 2015, using Jupityer notebooks. After I pass a solution, I then google the solution to see other ways people have solved it--and invariably find a cool, neat way I could have solved it that I hadn't thought of!

So really, this is just a way for me to track my progress and learning, including refactoring some of my own solutions to problems to redo them. I just stuck a readme.MD on it so that I wouldn't forget later, and so that if someone else wanted to use this method, they could do the same! Just clone the repo, create a virtual environment, and pip install the requirements! Then use "jupyter notebook" to open the notebook(s).
